## [Project 1: An Investigation into Goal-Scoring Trends in International Soccer](https://github.com/Rafli-Alfiansyah/Hypothesis-Testing-with-Men-and-Women-Soccer-Matches)

A statistical analysis to validate the hypothesis that more goals are scored in women's FIFA World Cup matches than in men's, using data from 2002 onwards.

### **Analysis & Findings**

* **Dataset**: A filtered dataset of **200 women's** and **384 men's** official FIFA World Cup matches played since January 1, 2002.
* **Statistical Method**: A **Mann-Whitney U test** was used to compare the goal distributions between the two groups, with a significance level ($\alpha$) of **0.10**.
* **Result**: The test yielded a **p-value of ~0.0051**.

### **Conclusion**

Since the p-value (0.0051) is significantly less than $\alpha$ (0.10), the null hypothesis is **rejected**. The data provides strong statistical evidence that, in the modern era, **more goals are scored in women's World Cup matches than in men's**. ‚öΩ

**Tool Used**: Python

## [Project 11: Production Trends & Audience Engagement Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/views/DV-CH1L1-VM1_17592089574340/IMDBAnalysisPart1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This dashboard provides an analysis of film and TV production trends, focusing on the years **2000 to 2015**. The key takeaway is a significant peak in production volume and audience voting in the early 2000s, followed by a decline in quantity but a rise in average ratings in subsequent years.

### **Production and Popularity Peak (Early 2000s)**

The data clearly shows that the period from **2001 to 2005** was the most active for production.

* **Number of Titles:** The number of titles produced, predominantly **Films**, reached its highest point between 2003 and 2005.
* **Audience Engagement:** The number of votes cast for these titles also peaked during this era, with the highest engagement seen from 2001 to 2003.

After 2006, both the number of titles produced and the volume of votes show a sharp and steady decline.

### **A Shift from Quantity to Quality**

An interesting trend emerges when comparing production volume to audience ratings. While the number of titles and votes decreased significantly after the mid-2000s, the **average rating** showed an upward trend.

The average rating fluctuated in the early 2000s but began to climb steadily after 2011, reaching a peak of **6.8 out of 10** in 2018. This suggests a potential shift in the industry or the dataset, where fewer titles were produced, but their perceived quality was higher.

### **Genre Landscape**

The treemap visualization breaks down the most common genres within the dataset.

* **Most Common Genres:** **Drama** is the most frequently produced genre, followed by **Comedy**, **Action**, and **Crime**.
* **Highest Rated Genres:** Based on the color intensity, genres like **Crime** and **Adventure** appear to have a higher average rating than others.
* **Dominant Type:** Across nearly all genres, **Films** are the most common type of production, far outnumbering TV Series or Miniseries.

#### **Tools Used**

* **Tableau**


## [Project 12: Film & TV Content Production and Rating Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/views/DV-CH1L2-VM1_17592092109460/IMDBAnalysisPart2?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This dashboard reveals a compelling story about the performance of different production types, with a clear winner in terms of audience appreciation. The main insight is that **TV Series consistently achieve higher average ratings than Films**, even though their quality can be more varied.

### The Rating Divide: TV Series Reign Supreme

The clearest takeaway comes from the distribution of ratings.

* **TV Series** have the highest median **average rating**, clustering around **7.0 out of 10**. This makes them the critical darlings compared to other formats. However, their ratings are also the most spread out, suggesting a "high-risk, high-reward" format‚Äîsome are major hits, while others are misses.
* **Films**, in contrast, are a much more predictable format. Their ratings are tightly packed around a lower median of approximately **6.0**. This indicates a consistent, but less impressive, reception from audiences.

### A Closer Look at Duration and Genre

The scatter plot confirms these findings and adds detail about content strategy.

* **Genre Blending:** Most productions (over 60%) are categorized as **multi-genre**, showing that combining styles is the dominant industry practice.
* **Duration and Quality:** Both **TV Series** and **TV Miniseries** tend to have longer durations and are where the highest ratings are found. Films and TV Movies typically have shorter runtimes and more average scores.

### A Puzzling Production Trend

The dashboard also points to a confusing production trend in the early 2000s. The data suggests a significant drop in the number of **TV Series** titles being produced between 2002 and 2005, while **TV Miniseries** saw modest growth.

In summary, the data tells a story where **TV Series** are the ambitious, higher-rated format, while **Films** are the more conventional and predictably-rated option.
