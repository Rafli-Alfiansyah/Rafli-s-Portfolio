## [Project 1: An Investigation into Goal-Scoring Trends in International Soccer](https://github.com/Rafli-Alfiansyah/Hypothesis-Testing-with-Men-and-Women-Soccer-Matches)

A statistical analysis to validate the hypothesis that more goals are scored in women's FIFA World Cup matches than in men's, using data from 2002 onwards.

### **Analysis & Findings**

* **Dataset**: A filtered dataset of **200 women's** and **384 men's** official FIFA World Cup matches played since January 1, 2002.
* **Statistical Method**: A **Mann-Whitney U test** was used to compare the goal distributions between the two groups, with a significance level ($\alpha$) of **0.10**.
* **Result**: The test yielded a **p-value of ~0.0051**.

### **Conclusion**

Since the p-value (0.0051) is significantly less than $\alpha$ (0.10), the null hypothesis is **rejected**. The data provides strong statistical evidence that, in the modern era, **more goals are scored in women's World Cup matches than in men's**. ‚öΩ

## [Project 11: Production Trends & Audience Engagement Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/views/DV-CH1L1-VM1_17592089574340/IMDBAnalysisPart1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This dashboard provides an analysis of film and TV production trends, focusing on the years **2000 to 2015**. The key takeaway is a significant peak in production volume and audience voting in the early 2000s, followed by a decline in quantity but a rise in average ratings in subsequent years.

### **Production and Popularity Peak (Early 2000s)**

The data clearly shows that the period from **2001 to 2005** was the most active for production.

* **Number of Titles:** The number of titles produced, predominantly **Films**, reached its highest point between 2003 and 2005.
* **Audience Engagement:** The number of votes cast for these titles also peaked during this era, with the highest engagement seen from 2001 to 2003.

After 2006, both the number of titles produced and the volume of votes show a sharp and steady decline.

### **A Shift from Quantity to Quality**

An interesting trend emerges when comparing production volume to audience ratings. While the number of titles and votes decreased significantly after the mid-2000s, the **average rating** showed an upward trend.

The average rating fluctuated in the early 2000s but began to climb steadily after 2011, reaching a peak of **6.8 out of 10** in 2018. This suggests a potential shift in the industry or the dataset, where fewer titles were produced, but their perceived quality was higher.

### **Genre Landscape**

The treemap visualization breaks down the most common genres within the dataset.

* **Most Common Genres:** **Drama** is the most frequently produced genre, followed by **Comedy**, **Action**, and **Crime**.
* **Highest Rated Genres:** Based on the color intensity, genres like **Crime** and **Adventure** appear to have a higher average rating than others.
* **Dominant Type:** Across nearly all genres, **Films** are the most common type of production, far outnumbering TV Series or Miniseries.

#### **Tools Used**

* **Tableau**


## [Project 12: Film & TV Content Production and Rating Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/views/DV-CH1L2-VM1_17592092109460/IMDBAnalysisPart2?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This dashboard reveals a compelling story about the performance of different production types, with a clear winner in terms of audience appreciation. The main insight is that **TV Series consistently achieve higher average ratings than Films**, even though their quality can be more varied.

### The Rating Divide: TV Series Reign Supreme

The clearest takeaway comes from the distribution of ratings.

* **TV Series** have the highest median **average rating**, clustering around **7.0 out of 10**. This makes them the critical darlings compared to other formats. However, their ratings are also the most spread out, suggesting a "high-risk, high-reward" format‚Äîsome are major hits, while others are misses.
* **Films**, in contrast, are a much more predictable format. Their ratings are tightly packed around a lower median of approximately **6.0**. This indicates a consistent, but less impressive, reception from audiences.

### A Closer Look at Duration and Genre

The scatter plot confirms these findings and adds detail about content strategy.

* **Genre Blending:** Most productions (over 60%) are categorized as **multi-genre**, showing that combining styles is the dominant industry practice.
* **Duration and Quality:** Both **TV Series** and **TV Miniseries** tend to have longer durations and are where the highest ratings are found. Films and TV Movies typically have shorter runtimes and more average scores.

### A Puzzling Production Trend

The dashboard also points to a confusing production trend in the early 2000s. The data suggests a significant drop in the number of **TV Series** titles being produced between 2002 and 2005, while **TV Miniseries** saw modest growth.

In summary, the data tells a story where **TV Series** are the ambitious, higher-rated format, while **Films** are the more conventional and predictably-rated option.

#### **Tools Used**

* **Tableau**


## [Project 13: A Snapshot of the Film Industry: Workforce and Production Trends](https://public.tableau.com/views/DV-CH2L1-VM1_17595027784820/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## [Project 15: Geospatial Analysis of Urban Property Listings](https://public.tableau.com/views/3_1_basic_maps_new_17595049510650/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This Tableau dashboard showcases four different geospatial visualization techniques to analyze property listings within a coastal city. Each map provides a unique perspective on the data, moving from a simple distribution of listings to a complex, multi-layered analysis of neighborhood characteristics. The dashboard is a powerful demonstration of how different mapping styles can be used to uncover distinct insights from the same dataset.

### Four Perspectives on Geospatial Data

The dashboard effectively uses four map styles to explore the data:

* **Basic Scatter Plot Map:** This map displays the raw **distribution and density** of individual property listings. It clearly shows that listings are heavily concentrated in the central and coastal areas of the city. 
* **Beautified Boundary Map:** This clean, minimalist map highlights the city's **administrative structure**, such as neighborhood boundaries. It is best used for showing high-level, aggregated data, like a city-wide average, without the clutter of individual points.

* **Overlaid Pie Chart Map:** This is the most information-dense visualization. It overlays **pie charts** on different neighborhoods to show proportional data at a glance. For example, it can be used to compare the percentage of verified versus non-verified hosts across different parts of the city, offering deeper insights into regional characteristics.

* **Mixed Polygon Map:** This map style provides a **fully aggregated view**, shading an entire region to represent a single, unified metric. It is ideal for displaying a top-level summary, such as the average price for the entire city.

#### **Tools Used**

* **Tableau**
  

## [Project 16: Visualizing the Visitor Journey in a Museum](https://public.tableau.com/views/DV-CH3L2-VM1_17595071919300/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This dashboard provides a multi-layered analysis of visitor traffic and flow within a museum, transforming raw location data into actionable insights. By visualizing not only where visitors congregate but also when and how they move through the space, the dashboard serves as a powerful tool for optimizing operations and enhancing the visitor experience.

### From Static Hotspots to Dynamic Flow

The analysis progresses through several layers of visualization to build a complete picture of visitor behavior.

* **Identifying Visitor Hotspots:** The initial view provides a static, high-level overview of visitor density. By using bubble charts overlaid on the museum floor plan, it immediately identifies which exhibits and areas, such as the **"Peter Dawson paintings"** and the **"Patio right,"** are the most consistently crowded. This is crucial for managing capacity and understanding exhibit popularity.

* **Understanding Daily Rhythms:** The dashboard becomes dynamic by animating visitor traffic on an hourly basis. This allows managers to see how crowd density shifts throughout the day. For example, one can observe that the **Museum Shop** becomes a major hotspot in the afternoon, which helps in optimizing staffing schedules and resource allocation.

* **Mapping the Visitor Journey:** The most advanced visualization reveals the **actual paths** visitors take as they navigate the museum. By tracing common routes, such as "Path A" and "Path B," the museum can understand visitor flow, identify potential bottlenecks, and strategically design the layout of exhibitions to guide visitors more effectively from one area to the next.

#### **Tools Used**

* **Tableau**


## [Project 17: Neighborhood Performance Analysis for Rental Properties](https://public.tableau.com/shared/CP9D67NGX?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This dashboard provides a multi-faceted analysis of rental property performance across various city neighborhoods. It uses a combination of unique and effective visualizations to display a high-level aggregate score, track historical trends, and conduct a detailed comparative analysis of pricing, allowing for a deep understanding of market dynamics at the neighborhood level.

### From a Single Score to Detailed Comparisons

The dashboard presents information in three distinct layers of granularity.

* **High-Level Performance Snapshot:** At the top, a **Waffle Chart** serves as a clear and immediate Key Performance Indicator (KPI). It visually represents the overall **average percentage score of 77.5%**, offering a quick, easy-to-digest summary of the current performance across all selected properties.

* **Historical Trends at a Glance:** A series of **Sparklines** provides a concise historical view of performance for each neighborhood from 2018 to 2022. This format is excellent for quickly comparing trends side-by-side and identifying patterns, such as a noticeable performance dip seen in several top neighborhoods during 2020-2021.

* **Comparative Price Analysis:** A **DNA Chart** (or dumbbell plot) is used to compare the average price range within each neighborhood. This chart excels at showing disparity. For instance, it highlights that **Sant Mart√≠** and **Sarri√†-Sant Gervasi** are the most expensive neighborhoods with the widest price variations, while **Nou Barris** is clearly the most affordable option.

#### **Tools Used**

* **Tableau**


## [Project 18: Exploring Barcelona's Neighborhoods: An Interactive Retreats Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/4_6_actionable_dashboard-sol_new_17595079308700/BarcelonaHighlights?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This interactive dashboard from "Barcelona Retreats" serves as a guided tool for users to explore and compare different neighborhoods in Barcelona. The dashboard cleverly uses interactivity, starting with a locked, high-level view that prompts the user to click on a map to "unlock further insights" and reveal detailed, interconnected data visualizations.

### **An Interactive, Multi-Layered Analysis**

The dashboard's strength lies in its use of cross-filtering, where selecting a neighborhood in one chart updates all other visualizations to focus on that specific area.

When a user first opens the dashboard, they are presented with a simple overview. After clicking on the main map, it transforms into a detailed choropleth map showing data for all neighborhoods. From there, selecting a specific neighborhood like **Eixample** instantly tailors the entire dashboard:

* The **price comparison chart** highlights Eixample's data.
* A **zoomable map** focuses on Eixample, showing the distribution of individual properties within its borders.
* The **crime rate trendline** for Eixample is emphasized.

### **Key Visualizations and Insights**

The dashboard allows for a comprehensive comparison of neighborhoods based on several key metrics:

* **Pricing Data**: A dumbbell plot effectively displays the minimum and average prices for each neighborhood. This chart clearly identifies areas like **Eixample** as having one of the highest average prices, while **Nou Barris** is the most affordable.
* **Property Distribution**: Users can zoom in to see the density and specific locations of properties within any chosen neighborhood.
* **Crime Rate Trends**: A series of sparklines provides a quick overview of whether crime rates are increasing or decreasing over time in each area, with red dots marking the most recent data points.

#### **Tools Used**

* **Tableau**
